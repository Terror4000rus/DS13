/*
	Code for generic leap attack

	A subtype of charge, leap performs a charge with a few specific differences:
		1. Homing is always off. Can't change direction in mid air
		2. The user is given PASS_FLAG_TABLE  and PASS_FLAG_FLYING for the duration of the leap, allowing them to fly over many lesser obstacles
		3. The user's layer is set to a higher one, making them draw over most things
		4. Once started, the leap does not stop if the user becomes incapacitated mid air
