Earthgov agents, by Kmc2000 (initial groundwork by theLion).
This antag uses two extensions, one which tracks "evidence" like photographs of suspicious things, and one which handles receipt of said evidence.
There's a few lists down below if you need to make any changes, these operate what counts as applicable evidence for the agents to submit.
