			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Asteroid Defense System, located on the top deck, above the bridge. It is only accessible via spacewalk along the spine of the ship. The ADS will automatically shoot down incoming asteroids, and it can also be manually controlled. There is currently no need for the manual control, but maybe someday soon it will start breaking down....</li>
