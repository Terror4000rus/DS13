      with some special credits.
2020-04-05:
  Nanako:
  - rscadd: The Marker, currently-posessed necromorphs, and signals now each have
      their own chat style in necrochat, prioritised in that order, so it's easier
      to tell who's speaking.
  - tweak: Admins can now read and mute necrochat
  - rscadd: Implemented the Puker, a brand new Tier 2 ranged necromorph. Puker is
      slow, but a flexible fighter and effective at all ranges
  - tweak: All necromorph acid attacks now slow the movespeed of their victims while
      coating the body. This currently applies to spitter, puker, and cysts
  - tweak: Slightly reduced necromorph limb health.
  - soundadd: Added firing audio for cyst corruption nodes.
  - rscadd: Charging attacks now have a motion blur effect
  - bugfix: Fixed a variety of animation bugs with leap, step-strike, basic attack
      animations, and windups for various abilities
  - rscadd: Charging necromorphs will now fall over if their legs are severed during
      a charge attack.
  - bugfix: Sawblades can no longer be worn on the ear
  - bugfix: Plasma cutter ammo clips now take much less backpack space
  - bugfix: Randomly generated names are now sane and normal, instead of being a mishmash
      of syllables

      and the Bridge.
  - rscadd: Added a clinic exit button for non-medical personnel.

  - rscadd: Added an ore scanner to planet cracker's lockers.
  - maptweak: Added more items to the bartender's closet.

  Nanako:
  - bugfix: Fixed necrochat randomly breaking.
  - rscadd: Necromorph acid can now damage clothing. Any acid that doesn't reach the
      skin will splash onto worn equipment instead, gradually eating through it. As
      equipment takes damage, it lets more chemicals through. Items can also be damaged
      enough to be completely destroyed. This effect applies to all sources of acid.
      Puker, Spitter, Cysts
  - tweak: Biosuits and labcoats are now extremely resistant to acid.
  - tweak: Guns are now immune to acid, and won't melt.
  - tweak: Tools now take damage from acid instead of just melting outright.

      No more taking damage from acid you can hardly see. Examining the patch will
      tell whether or not its safe to walk on.

  - bugfix: Acid pools can no longer be pulled around.
  - rscadd: Added a massive new system for abilities that can be used by signals and
      markers, found in the Abilities tab. Abilities cost Psi Energy which is passively
      gained over time, and have an extremely broad range of functions. Many more
      abilities will be added in future.
  - tweak: Nerfed cyst damage a bit. There will be a lot more of them around now.
  - tweak: Buffed starting biomass.
  - imageadd: Implemented the Vintage rig, with sprites by Mr Mann. The vintage rig
      is an extremely bulky antique suit that significantly slows the user, but provides
      a ton of protection and a few useful modules. Both Chief Engineer, Director
      of Mining and Captain get a copy of the vintage rig
  - rscadd: Added the healthbar rig module, which displays the user's health in a
      meter along their spine. The healthbar is standard equipment in all rigs.

      an infestation.

      held items or their own arms. Blocking is automatic as long as you face towards

      have been made to offset it.
  - soundadd: Blocking attacks now has visual and audio effects.
  - experiment: Melee attacks are now guaranteed to hit, both human and necromorph.

      and during low population times. Increased the maximum limit for high population
      times.
  - bugfix: Fixed various issues that occur when a signal or marker player disconnects
      and reconnects.
  - tweak: Significantly increased the damage dealt by thrown objects. Chucking things
      at necromorphs is a pretty valid combat style now..
  - rscadd: Added the Heavy Pulse Rifle, a powerful new weapon, currently only obtainable
      through adminspawning.
  Snypehunter007:

  Nanako:
  - rscadd: All necromorphs now have partial darkvision, allowing them to see better
      in dark areas. This can be toggled with 'Toggle Darkvision' in the abilities
      menu. Not all necromorphs are equal in this regard, leapers and lurkers have
      better darkvision, ubermorph has the best of all. Exploders get very poor darkvision,
      as they have their own light source.
  - tweak: Slightly buffed the movespeed and regen effects of corruption
  - bugfix: Fixed pukers being unable to aim and rotate during their vomit attack
